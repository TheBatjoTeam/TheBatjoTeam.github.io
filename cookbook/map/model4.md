<em>We are omitting the step-by-step text instructions for this part because it is not strictly about modeling data objects. You can simply download the provided <a href = "/cookbook/map/resources">FreeCAD files</a> to fabricate this element without modeling it, or watch the video tutorial if you wish to learn how to model this object anyway.</em></p>
