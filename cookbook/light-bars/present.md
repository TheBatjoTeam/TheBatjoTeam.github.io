Depending on the setting in which the data installation is hosted, on its lifespan, on the tone of the content, and your available budget, you can complement the installation with other elements that enhance its fruition. The following paragraph lists a few presentation options you could explore further when designing the setting for the news installation. The core idea is that, while the physical installation functions as a hub to present the data supporting your story and to foster social interactions around it, it is not the only one. You can devise ways to make the installation a multimedia one, by embedding print, video, audio components and by referencing back to other online articles of your publication. 

<ul>
<li>Add printed panels around the installation for more context.</li>

<li>The bars can be placed in other directions, not necessarily vertically and lined up close to each other. You can place them horizontally one below the other, or you can place them in a way that exploits the characteristics of the architecture/environment of the location where the installation is placed.</li>

<li>Add QR code that directly link participants to articles, video, data visualizations, audio, and other materials present on your website, so that the participants can learn more. In this sense, the place where you host the installation could be perceived as a physical/digital archive where participants can navigate through the whole dossier of information a newsroom has on a specific issue.</li>

<li>If the topic allows for a more cheerful mood, you can be creative and provide different props to hit the sensor with</li>

<li>Organize talks, debates and events and have the speakers animate the crowd by randomly calling people to interact with the installation </li>
</ul>

These are some options to say that every installation will in practice be unique to the content and context. And while its fruition is technically the last phase of the project, it should be the very first thing you have in mind before you move on to design, model and build the physical data experiences.
