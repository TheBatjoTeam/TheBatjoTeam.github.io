<em>We are omitting the step-by-step text instructions for this part because it is not strictly about how to create GCode for data-driven objects. You can still watch the video to learn how to proceed. We strongly advise you to also get in touch with the machine operator you will be working with, to make sure the GCode you create works with the machines you will use.</em></p>
