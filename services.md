*The [Batjo team ](/team) can be contacted for a personalized consultancy for anything that regards data storytelling and digital fabrication.*

Depending on your newsroom's needs and the skill set of its employees, we can assist with:

- **Data consultancy**: from data scraping to data visualization, all the steps needed to get the data for your story in shape.
- **Design consultancy**: defining the appearance, interaction and specs of the physical data installation for your story
- **Development consultancy**: starting from the design, we can produce the 3D modeling files and the G-Code needed to fabricate the physical data installation and all its components. We'll leave you all the files we produce, so that you can use them again for future work.
- **Production**: depending on the needs of your project, we can fabricate it with the machines we have. If the machines of our lab are not suited for the task, we'll refer you to someone who can take care of it. 

### Free services

We are open to the idea of contributing our time to projects with a high social value which can't afford to pay for our services.   

Unfortunately, we can offer to do so only for a limited number of times throughout the year, depending on our financial and time management contraints. If you believe you are working on a high-impact projcect that could benefit from our help, but don't have the budget, get in touch anyway and we'll consider your proposal. Make sure to specify that you are looking for a free consultancy and include also any information you think might help us evaluate your case: are you a no-profit? do you have an established curriculum of impactful work? what communities do you serve? and anything else you deem important for our decision.
